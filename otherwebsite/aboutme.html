                </div>
                <p>As a part of my academic curriculum, I had to enroll in a course called "Computer and Programming" Where I got introduced to Python. I enjoyed learning about it and longed to learn deeper. However, my busy schedule and other responsibilities overcame my interest and I slowly lost touch with the world of programming.</p>

                </div>
                <p>At Chulalongkorn University's Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, I developed strong communication skills and gained hands-on experience in various scientific techniques. I prepared blood samples for immunoassays and learned about the outbreak trends to identify potential causes of viral infections. Additionally I received primary training in conducting research and studying virology-related data.</p>

                <p>In my senior project year, I gained communication skills by working with diverse people, I also designed and executed a senior project plan, which included planning and conducting experiments, analyzing data, and presenting my findings to both faculty and peers. This experience helped me to develop organizational, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills.</p>
